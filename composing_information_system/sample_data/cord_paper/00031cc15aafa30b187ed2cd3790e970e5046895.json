The virus causes kidney injury by either direct infection or systemic effects, including host immune clearance and immune tolerance disorders, endothelium-mediated vasculitis, thrombus formation, glucose and lipid metabolism disorder, and hypoxia. Key Messages: Renal injury by SARS-CoV-2 is the result of multiple factors. Via highly expressed ACE2 in renal tissue, SARS-CoV-2 infection fundamentally initiates a mechanism of renal injury. Systemic effects such as host immune clearance and immune tolerance disorders, endothelial cell injury, thrombus formation, glucose and lipid metabolism disorder, and hypoxia aggravate this renal injury.",

Statistical data show that the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection constitutes an epidemic threat to the world. The exponential increase in patients has led to more than 10 million confirmed cases worldwide, with more than 0.5 million deaths so far [2] . Besides respiratory syndromes, the disease could lead to multisystem involvement, such as myocarditis, gastrointestinal symptoms, and acute liver injury. There is accumulating evidence indicating that SARS-CoV2 infection may lead to acute kidney injury (AKI). Several clinical observations have shown characteristics of renal dysfunction such as increased serum creatinine (SCr), variable degrees of proteinuria and hematuria, and even renal fibrosis. There are many conflicting results from clinical phenotypes, and the mechanisms involved remain unclear.",

            "text": "The functions of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection can be divided into two categories: a peptidase function and a peptidase-independent function. ACE2, a homologue of ACE, is a powerful negative peptide of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and balances the various functions of ACE. The RAS plays a key role in maintaining blood pressure homeostasis and water-salt balance. Renin, cleaving angiotensinogen, produces angiotensin I (Ang I), which is transformed by cleavage of ACE into Ang II. Ang II binds to two G protein-coupled receptors, angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) and angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AT2R), performing biological functions: vasoconstriction, elevating blood pressure, and promoting inflammation, oxidative stress and cell apoptosis. Evidence suggests that by degrading Ang II into Ang (1-7), ACE2 negatively regulates the activated RAS, and shows protective effects: vasodilation, as well as suppression of inflammation, oxidative stress and cell apoptosis. During SARS-CoV-2 infection, after binding to SARS-CoV-2, the external domain of ACE2 is cleaved, and the transmembrane domain is internalized, leading to downregulation of ACE2 and an increase in Ang II levels, thereby promoting the \"immunoinflammatory storm\" [8] (Fig. 1) .",

            "text": "Additionally, ACE2 was recognized as a functional receptor for cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2. Like other coronaviruses, S proteins on the envelope of SARS-CoV-2 can be functionally divided into S1 and S2 subunits. S1 is crucial for binding to receptors, while S2 is responsible for membrane fusion of cell entry [9] . When S1 binds to the peptidase domain of ACE2 by the receptor-binding domain, the cleavage site on S2 is cleaved by host proteases, leading to membrane fusion between the virus and target cell, enhancing the S protein-driven viral infection (Fig. 2 ) [10] . Apart from direct membrane fusion, pH-dependent endocytosis may be another way for viral infection [11] . During cellular entry, the coronavirus is likely to bind to and internalize with ACE2, resulting in downregulation of the ACE2 protein and an increase in Ang II levels, promoting the inflammatory effects of the RAS, which is involved in acute lung injury and the severest form of acute respiratory distress syndrome [7, 8] . When SARS-CoV-2 invades the body, innate immune cells, as the first line of defense, start the immune response against the virus including immune clearance and anti-infection immune tolerance. Immune clearance is a response for the identification and clearance of coronaviruses, while anti-infection immune tolerance is a mechanism which controls the immune response to avoid immune overreaction. An imbalance between immune clearance and immune tolerance may lead to anti-infection immune intolerance, manifesting as immune overreaction, which causes organ injury by proinflammatory cytokines and an impaired adaptive immune response.",

The frequency was 88.0 and 70.2%, respectively, followed by fatigue (42.8%) and sputum production (36.0%) [20] . The other, uncommon symptoms were headache (11.8%), sore throat (14.0%), gastrointestinal symptoms (anorexia, nausea, or vomiting [8.9%]), upper airway symptoms (rhinorrhea, sneeze, or nasal congestion [7.6%]), and diarrhea (6.1%). A majority of patients had lymphocytopenia and electrolyte imbalance including hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and hyponatremia. Severe complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection included acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, and acute renal failure [21] . About a quarter of patients have at least one underlying chronic disorder, including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic kidney disease [22] . Numerous studies have suggested that renal functional impairment mainly manifests as kidney dysfunction (elevated blood urea nitrogen [BUN] and SCr), abnormal urinary analysis (proteinuria and hematuria), and radiographic abnormalities of the kidneys [23] [24] [25] [26] . The most common clinical presentation is proteinuria, which is found in more than half of the patients before or after admission, followed by hematuria, elevated BUN, and elevated SCr (33.7, 14.3, and 10.7%, respectively). A metaanalysis further revealed that patients presented with varying degrees of albuminuria (+ in 38.8% of the patients, and ++ or +++ in 10.6% of the patients). During SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in critically ill patients, AKI was proved to be an important risk factor for mortality [23] . Among those with SARS-CoV-2 infection and AKI, 33.9% of the patients were reported dead after hospitalization, and the mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection plus AKI was significantly higher than without renal injury (p < 0.001) [27] . Furthermore, inflammation and edema of the renal parenchyma, seen by CT scan, are equally common [23] . The main manifestations of renal injury are summarized in Table 1 .",

Human tissue single-cell RNA sequencing data and ACE2 staining revealed that the kidneys and bladder are enriched with ACE2 [12, 33] , which results in susceptibility of the renal tissue to SARS-CoV-2. Clusters of coronavirus-like particles are found in the renal tubular epithelium and podocytes, and special SARS-CoV-2 nucleoproteins could be seen in a nuclear or cytoplasmic pattern via indirect fluorescence [12, 18] , which suggests that SARS-CoV-2 could directly infect renal cells. Autopsy results showed that after infection of the respiratory tract, the virus entered the blood and induced viremia [34] . Hence, we infer that the virus could reach the urinary system through blood circulation, bind to and internalize with ACE2 receptors, infect kidney cells expressing the ACE2 receptor, including renal tubular epithelial cells, podocytes, and others. However, according to current research, the viral load in the kidneys is low and unevenly distributed [12, 34] , so it cannot wholly explain the extensive kidney damage.",

Meanwhile, high concentrations of viral nucleic acid (RNA), due to the weakened immune clearance, lead to activation of the interferon (IFN)-1 signaling pathway and JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and consequently to the production of a high level of inflammatory cytokines, causing damage to the body [37] . Activation of the IFN-1 signaling pathway can lead to the production of an autoreactive adaptive immune response, which can aggravate the tissue damage.

Besides, because of the feedback mechanism, lymphopenia stimulates the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines, which causes severe damage to tissues and organs. As for NK cells, which can nonspecifically kill virus-infected cells, it has been proved that NK cells are strongly activated in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and they highly express perforin, NKG2C, and Ksp37 in severe cases.

However, in addition to podocyte damage, severe endothelial damage was also observed, including swelling, foamy changes, and subcutaneous transmittal expansion.

The mechanism is unclear, but it was first speculated to be related to dysfunction of the RAS. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, ACE2 expression is decreased, which increases Ang II formation, leading to tissue edema. In addition to the RAS disorder, IL-6 is released by monocytes and macrophages, which leads to electrolyte imbalance and increases the circulation volume by inducing the nonosmotic release of vasopressin.

In the kidneys, hypoxia may contribute to AKI [53] . Hypoxemia reduces renal blood flow by a number of mechanisms, including stimulation of adrenergic nerves and disturbances in nitric oxide metabolism. Severe hypoxia and ischemia can both result in microvasculature dysfunction. This can impact adjacent intrinsic cells and capillaries, extending the regions of hypoxia, leading to organ failure [54, 55] .",

In addition, it has been proved that immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin and mycophenolic acid may be good candidates for therapeutic medicines against renal damage by SARS-CoV-2 [61, 62] , and specific inhibitors of IL-6 appear to be beneficial in severely infected cases [43] . However, it may be reasonable to further study these agents in controlled trials. Tocilizumab, as a needle-mediated monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptor, is being tested in a preclinical trial (ChiCTR2000029765). The results of this study are much anticipated and expected. Since ACE2 is a functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2, it has been found that human recombinant soluble ACE2 can competitively bind to SARS-CoV-2, thereby reducing the organ damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 entering target cells. In vitro studies have shown that human recombinant soluble ACE2 can significantly block SARS-CoV-2 infection in human renal organs in a dose-dependent manner and is an effective way to protect renal function in the future [63] .",

Blood purification technologies include plasmapheresis, adsorption, perfusion, and hemofiltration, especially continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), since CRRT has played an important role in the rescue and treatment of patients with SARS, MERS, and other cases of sepsis [64, 65] . CRRT is recommended for use as soon as possible in severely infected patients manifesting macroalbuminuria on admission, as it may remove inflammatory cytokines and protect renal function, particularly in those patients with elevated SCr levels [23] . The therapeutics listed above would be helpful to patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, but their efficacy needs to be further studied and confirmed. Kidney Dis DOI: 10.1159/000512683",

The mechanism of renal injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been fully clarified. However, our current understanding suggests that the ACE2 signaling pathway plays a key role in mediating renal injury. It is important to monitor kidney injury in the management of SARS-CoV-2. The earlier treatments achieve a better clinical outcome. Patients with AKI are recommended to receive CRRT in order to both protect renal function and remove inflammatory cytokines, which may accelerate the process of disease recovery.",
