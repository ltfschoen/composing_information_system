At the same time, the non-COVID-19 patients had to discontinue or delay their normal therapy owing to the lockdown policies, limited medical resources, and the predicted increased risk of infection, especially for patients with cancer.

The questionnaire was designed to include demographic characteristics and four validated psychological assessment scales. The clinical features and current treatments were additionally recorded for patients with BC. The four scales included the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R). All participants were asked to answer the questionnaire online by using the most popular social media software in China, Wechat. We issued the questionnaire in the WeChat groups from February 1 to 19, 2020, when the daily number of confirmed cases was at its peak. The daily pandemic curve showed that the number of reported cases increased rapidly after January 10, reaching the pandemic peak on February 5, after which point it declined slowly (5) .",

The PHQ-9 with nine items and the GAD-7 with seven items were rated from 0 (\"almost never\") to 3 (\"almost always\"). Based on the scores obtained on these scales, the severity of anxiety or depression for participants was divided into normal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) , and severe (>15).The respondents whose scores were higher than 4 in PHQ-9 or GAD-7 were thought to have depressive or anxiety symptoms.",

The Chinese government quickly took powerful and effective measures to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the lockdown of Wuhan city, integration of personal and medical resources, and the construction of Fangcang shelter hospitals (12) . Under this unique circumstance, patients with cancer and healthcare workers experienced significant mental stress. In this study, we focused on the psychological status of BC patients and female nurses in Wuhan city at the peak time-point of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our survey showed that more than half of BC patients had symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia, and over one-third of BC patients endured distress. The proportion of psychological problems in BC patients was comparable to that of frontline female nurses. Because of limited medical resources, a higher risk of infection with COVID-19, and the possibility of experiencing worse outcomes after infection, the BC patients had to delay or discontinue their planned anti-cancer treatments, increasing the psychological pressure on these individuals. Our study showed that more than half of BC patients suffered from depression (51.2%), anxiety (62.8%), and sleep problems (51.2%), and over one-third of BC patients experienced PTSD symptoms (35.3%). These proportions of psychological problems were higher than those from previous reports in normal situations. BC patients already have a lot of psychological stress as a result of the diagnosis and treatment of the tumor in their bodies. Recent systematic studies have summarized the prevalence of psychological problems in BC patients (13, 14) . The results showed that nearly one-third (32.2%) of BC patients experienced depression (13) and nearly 10% of patients (9.6%) had PTSD (14) . However, the prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and PTSD displayed great discrepancies from previous studies (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) , partly due to the utilization of different definitions, measurements, populations, and the timing of assessments. Therefore, we compared the severity of the psychological problems of BC patients with those of female nurses in the same place and during the same period of the pandemic.",

Many health care workers suffered great psychological pressure during the outbreak of the pandemic. Many studies have shown that healthcare workers, especially nurses, endured significantly high psychological problems during the outbreak of SARS or MERS (18) (19) (20) (21) . In our recent study, we assessed the magnitude of mental health outcomes and associated factors among 1,257 healthcare workers for COVID-19 patients in multiple regions of China (3). The results showed that a considerable proportion of healthcare workers reported experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress. This was especially true for frontline female nurses from the epicenter, Wuhan. We accordingly deduced that frontline female nurses in Wuhan are under the most severe psychological pressure. In this survey, more than half of frontline female nurses suffered from depression (202/334, 60.5%) and anxiety (186/334, 55.7%), and over one-third of female nurses experienced sleep problems (154/334, 46.1%) and PTSD (111/334, 33.2%). The proportions of symptomatic depression, anxiety, insomnia, and PTSD in frontline female nurses were significantly higher than those in non-frontline female nurses. However, our results showed that BC cancer patients were under psychological pressure comparable to that of the frontline female nurses at the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. This is the first report offering a direct comparison of psychological status between patients and nurses during the pandemic. BC patients, in fact, were found to suffer worse symptoms of insomnia than female frontline nurses.",

There were significant differences in age, marital status, and levels of education between the BC patients and female nurses. They were all women living in Wuhan, who had to go to hospitals while being at a greater risk of infection with COVID-19. Nurses are at the forefront of fighting the pandemic, and their psychological state easily attracts public attention. By comparing the psychological status of BC patients with that of nurses, we were able to obtain a greater understanding of the psychological state of the BC patients. It is important to pay attention to the psychological status of people with chronic illnesses during the outbreak of a pandemic.",

However, in addition to obtaining support through online or offline services from professional health care workers (22) , necessities from social volunteers, BC patients also need to receive more support from their families. This is crucial because most remained at home during the pandemic. Several reports have demonstrated the importance of family support for patients. A prospective study with a long-term follow-up for patients showed that family support was associated with both low levels of, and quick improvement from, depression (23) . For BC patients aged more than 55 years, family support from adult children might decrease their levels of anxiety and depression (24) . Kamen et al. (25) showed that family support was related to less severe insomnia at baseline in BC patients. Additionally, one previous study demonstrated that family support could avoid or alleviate certain mood difficulties in BC patients in the Chinese population (26) . Therefore, people need to be educated regarding the importance of providing support for BC family members, especially during epidemic outbreaks.",

Third, the direct comparison of psychological pressures between BC patients and nurses might not be appropriate because of different influencing factors in the two distinct groups. However, our findings indicated that when BC patients were forced to delay or discontinue treatment due to the pandemic, their psychological pressures increased greatly. The differences in psychological status among other populations, such as the normal population, BC patients more recently diagnosed from other areas, and patients with other chronic diseases, should be evaluated in future. Moreover, effective measures for alleviating the psychological pressures of BC patients, both during and after the pandemic, should be investigated.",
